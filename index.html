        <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living in the southern regions of present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast in West Africa. Akan people are believed to have migrated to their current location from the Sahara desert and Sahel regions of Africa into the forest region around the 11th century. Many Akans tell their history as it started in the eastern region of Africa as this is where the ethnogenesis of the Akan as we know them today happened. The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>

        <p>This website gets you an Akan name, deriving it from your birthday, and all you need is to put in your birthday! The names are gender-specific, which simply means that boys and girls each have thier own names... <strong>no sharing!</strong></p>
